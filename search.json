    "text": "First post (yayyyy!): This semester I’m excited yet terrified to be taking MicroPs. The reason I want to take this class is because I really enjoyed the E85 Labs and felt like I learned a lot from completing the work. Even though these labs were time intensive and challenging, I did feel very rewarded once it was finished and felt more confident about digital systems leaving the class. After talking to many people who have already taken E155, I do believe there is a lot more knowledge for me to gain after completing the curriculum and I’m curious to see what thsi semester has in store. I know that this class is very unique in how its set up along with the depth of content, so I know that an opportunity to take this class will be very difficult to come across again.\nFrom this class, I hope to feel very confident about approaching digital systems in the real world and be more fluent in what I learned from E85. I also hope to improve my debugging skills, whether that’s the process of how I debug or my natural intuition. Finally, I hope that I am able to understand how to persevere through challenging struggles using sheer grit. In whatever field I decide to pursue in the future, I know that learning how to push through problems will be important to my success."

    "text": "Main Goals\nThe main goals of this lab were to use a time-multiplexing schematic to drive 2 separate 7 segement LED displays with a single set of pins on the FPGA and Verilog code. In addition, a transistor was required to use in order to drive larger currents from the FPGA pins to power the LED displays. An additional LED display was also used to report the sum of the 2 7 segement LED displays in binary format. Finally, a function testbench needed to be created in ModelSim to test the System Verilog code and ensure that each of the modules created worked as expected."

    "section": "Design Approach",
    "text": "Design Approach\n\nSystem Verilog Design\nThe System Verilog code created consisted of an oscillator submodule that would return alternating values used to turn the transistors on and off. This submodule utilized an internal high speed oscillator running at 2.4kHz, so that the values displayed on the LED are going fast enough that it looks like the values are being displayed simultaneously. These alternating bits are inputed into a mux that will output the desired switch input used between the two switch inputs assigned to the board. This desired switch input will then be fed into the sevenSeg display code used in Lab 1 that will output the desired values to the 7 segment displays.\n\n\n\nBlock diagram of System Verilog Modules\n\n\n\n\n7 Segment Circuit Design\nSince there are 2 segments that will be alternating between two digits with the same set of FPGA pins, a transistor was needed to control whether each of the digits should display an LED value or if it should be turned off completely. Since the LED display used was a common anode, we could connect a PNP transistor to drive the common anode’s current to high when it is on or low when it is off. For the display, that means pins 13 and 14 were each connected to their own transistor’s output. I then connected both of the LED segments respective outputs to the same FPGA pins. The various pins that controlled the display were connected to the FPGA board using 220 Ohm resistors in order to achieve 7 mA of current.\n\n\n\nCalculation to find the resistor value for the 7 segment display\n\n\n\n\nTransistor Circuit Design\nBecause the LED display used was a common anode display, a PNP transistor was needed in order to drive the current high. The emitter of the circuit was connected to the FPGA pin that oscillated between low and high values determining whether or not the circuit was turned on. When values were low, current from the base voltage would be high and flow through the LED load to turn it on. A base resistor was needed to connect the 3.3 V to the base of the transistor so that not too much current is drawn from the FPGA pins. The calculated resistor value needed for the base was 130 Ohms, but 150 Ohms was used instead since that was readily available from the stockroom.\n\n\n\nCalculation to find the resistor value for the transistor\n\n\n\n\nLED Sum Circuit Design\nThe LED display used was grounded with 220 Ohm resistors for the same reason the seven segment display was. The input of this circuit was the output of combinational logic written in System Verilog.\n\n\nPin Assignment\nFinally, the pins from the FPGA needed to be correctly assigned to the switches, Leds, and 7-segment display on the board. The s, seg, and led variables defined in System Verilog were assigned to physical pins on the board shown as the following:\n\nPin assignment to System Verilog variables\n\n\nvariable\npin #\n\n\n\n\ns1[0]\n37\n\n\ns1[1]\n31\n\n\ns1[2]\n35\n\n\ns1[3]\n32\n\n\ns2[0]\n11\n\n\ns2[1]\n19\n\n\ns2[2]\n21\n\n\ns2[3]\n10\n\n\nledDisplay[0]\n46\n\n\nledDisplay[1]\n45\n\n\nledDisplay[2]\n3\n\n\nledDisplay[3]\n44\n\n\nledDisplay[4]\n9\n\n\nseg[0]\n47\n\n\nseg[1]\n2\n\n\nseg[2]\n13\n\n\nseg[3]\n20\n\n\nseg[4]\n18\n\n\nseg[5]\n12\n\n\nseg[6]\n48\n\n\nselector1\n6\n\n\nselector2\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Circuit Schematic for Entire System"

A set of additional testbench files in System Verilog were created to test each of the submodules’s functionality.\n\nOscillator Testing\nIn order to check if the oscillator function was working properly, a clock signal was generated with 1 timestep. A dut (device under test) was then instantiated calling the oscillator function. The testbench was then run for 1 M ns. When looking at the output of the testbench in the Wave view, it shows that the output of the oscillator changes value every 10000 ns, while the internal clock is oscillating at a much faster rate as expected.\n\n\n\nTestbench output for Oscillator module\n\n\n\n\nMux Testing\nIn order to check if the mux function was working properly, a clock signal was generated with 10 timestep. A dut (device under test) was then instantiated calling the mux function. At the start of the simulation, input values for switch inputs 1 and 2 were set to 8 and 0 respectively. A selector was then set to 1 so that the first switch value was chosen. A separate variable containing the expected output was created so that it can be compared with the output of the mux. After 2 more clock signals, the selector’s value was changed to 0 so that the output of the mux is changed as well. In the simulation’s Wave view, the output of the mux (s) and the expected value of the mux (s_expected) match each other’s values.\n\n\n\nTestbench output for Mux module\n\n\n\n\nSum Testing\nIn order to check if the sum function was working properly, a clock signal was generated with 10 timestep. A dut (device under test) was then instantiated calling the sum function. At the start of the simulation, input values for switch 1 and 2 were set to various values, along with a new variable that was the expected sum of the two switch inputs. After running the simulation for 2 clock signals, the input values of the switches and the expected sum were updated to different values. In the simulation’s Wave view, it can be seen that the expected sum value matched the output of the sum module as desired. Thus, the module behaved as expected.\n\n\n\nTestbench output for Sum module\n\n\n\n\nSeven Segment Display Testing\nIn order to check if the Seven Segement display function was working properly, a clock signal was generated with 10 timestep.

Led[2] needed to blink at 2.4 Hz using an internal high-speed oscillator. By using the starter code provided in the fpga_dev_board_test file, a new maximum counter value needed to be calculated. Since the internal oscillator is running at 48 MHz, we get the number of counts to be 10M to get an led blinking at 2.4 MHz assuming we want a 50% duty cycle. An additional variable needed to be created in order to check if the led should be turned on or off every time the counter gets to 10M.\n\n\n\nCalculation to find the number of counts\n\n\n\n\n7 Segment Display Design\nIn order to design the 7-segment display, I had to use a series of case statement for the 16 different outputs to be displayed based on the switches in a separate submodule. It was important to set pin 3 on the display to the 3.3 V so that it is always on. Thus, the segement’s cathode will turn the segement on when it is set to 0. Each case statement set the output segement values to 0 when that segement should be turned on based on what binary value was currently set on the input switches. This code was written in a separate file but was called in the same file that controlled the 3 Leds. In order to wire the 7-segment display, the various pins that controlled the display were connected to the FPGA board using 240 Ohm resistors in order to achieve 10 mA of current.\n\n\n\nCalculation to find the resistor value for the 7 segment display\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock Diagram of System Verilog module\n\n\n\n\nPin Assignment\nFinally, the pins from the FPGA needed to be correctly assigned to the switches, Leds, and 7-segment display on the board.

    "text": "This lab was a great introduction for the class because a lot of the content of assembly and system verilog code was content I had learned from E85. Since it has been a year since I have taken the class, it did take me some time to go through my E85 notes and recall some of the syntax used. One new thing about this lab was definitely using GitHub. I have used GitHub once before in CS70, but the repositories were pre-made for us and easily cloned. Thus, it was definitely difficult for me at first to use, and even now I am still not completely confident on pushing/branching. I hope that this hesitancy will start to go away as I get more practice using GitHub for future labs.\nFrom this lab, I think I’m starting to understand the perseverance and grit needed to get through MicroPs. Up until this semester, I had only heard a series of horror stories from MicroP alums, so I was very unsure if I could handle the workload this class supposedly would induce. Now that I have finished my first class, I can now personally confirm that the horror stories I had heard are true. However, I do think that the workload could possibly be managed if I keep the following thoughts in mind:\n\nAsk for help when needed.\nTake a break when stressed and then come back later.\nStruggling is unfortunately a part of the learning process."

    "text": "In this week’s lab, I learned how to use a mux and transistor to drive 2 seven segment displays at once. Something I really struggled with during the lab was understanding how the transistor worked to control whether or not current flowed through, and why the transistor was needed. I have learned about transistors before in E84 and E85, but I had only understood it from a high level as a “switch”. I never understood how that switch would actually be implemented, so this lab forced me to do so in order for my circuit to function as desired.\nSomething I also took away from this lab was the importance of neat wiring. Since this lab required a lot of wires and circuitry, I was halfway through wiring everything up when I realized how messy the final product was going to be. As a result, a lot of wire could easily be unattached as I’m moving around the board and it would be more difficult to debug or spot. In the future, I’m going to pay more attention about planning out my board layout before I start wiring.\n\n\n\nMessy Wiring from Lab 2 :()\n\n\nFinally, I learned how to make testbenches without testvectors. Initially, I was having trouble trying to make testvectors since the output of the module would be constantly oscillating. However, after talking to the tutors, they emphasized that the point of a testbench is to ensure that the modules work as desired, and can be easily done without testvectors. This was my first time making a testbench without testvectors, and I will continue to do so for future labs."
