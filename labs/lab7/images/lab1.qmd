Hi! My name is Audrey and I'm a current Engineering student at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu).

Currently, I'm an APISPAM Head Sponsor, Atwood Dorm President, and Machine Shop Proctor at Harvey Mudd. The past few summers, I have been able to participate in summer research with Prof. Dodds in "Summer Start-Up" and with Prof. Gokli as part of the Riggs Fellowship. I was previously HMC 2025 Class President and also a member of the Prisoner Education Project. 

I'm currently a resident of Southern California, and have lived here my entire life. (If you have any recommendations of things to do in CA, please let me know!). In my free time, I love to play pickleball, try new foods, and spend time with friends.

If you are interested in learning more about me, please feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-vo-us23/).
